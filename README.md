# What

Anki deck with:
- Serbian words from the open-subtitles 2018 frequency list (huge list but duplication due to word forms)
- translations (using translate-shell tool, google service specifically)
- wiktionary articles for both scripts where present
- fallback example sentences generated by Davinci/ChatGPT AI model

# But

It is as it is.
I didn't verify the content since I'm a learner myself.
Actually for this reason AI-produced example sentences are below of other content.
Feel free to create an issue but keep in mind that I don't check these often.

Quality-wise there is rare random unrelated wikidictionary content presence but it is not worth looking into.

TODO: test usability outside of a tablet. Update title if needed.

# How

It should be easy to adapt to other languages.
If you need only Wiktionary articles based on words list then the first two and the last two dependencies should be enough.
The final two could be replaceable by some other tooling/library.

Install dependencies:
- ruby-lanugage
- run `bundle install` in the root of the repo (it probably needs `ruby-dev` package if it fails on this step)
- translate-shell terminal tool
- esc2html terminal tool
- cligpt terminal tool (it needs OpenAI credential to run, free account lasts for a couple of thousand requests)
  or chatgpt-wrapper tool (it's limit is 150 requests per hour at the time)
  (`config.rb` has examples of configuration for both options)
- anki-cli-unofficial terminal tool
- sqlite3 (terminal tool is used)

Configure most of things:
- `confing.rb` - constants
- `2_compose_deck.rb` - what you use and in what order

Run numerated ruby files in their order.
