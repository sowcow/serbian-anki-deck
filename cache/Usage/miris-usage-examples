*Miris* je uvijek bio izvor nježnosti i ljubavi. (The scent was always a source of tenderness and love.)

U kući je još uvijek bila prisutna *mirisa* vrbe. (In the house, the scent of willow was still present.)

*Mirišu* li te još uvijek cvjetovi? (Do the flowers still smell you?)

Njegov *miris* je bio toliko ugodan. (His scent was so pleasant.)

Ušuškan u *mirisima* zemlje, on je svojim mirom pomirio narod. (Enveloped in the scents of the earth, he pacified the people with his peace.)
