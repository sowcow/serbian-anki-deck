Sure! Here are five example sentences that use the word "njezin" in different forms and positions:

1. Njezin pas je jako poslu≈°an. (Her dog is very obedient.)
2. Jeste li vidjeli njezinu novu torbu? (Have you seen her new bag?)
3. Ona je njezina najbolja prijateljica. (She is her best friend.)
4. Kupila je novi automobil, ali njezin je stari bio bolji. (She bought a new car, but her old one was better.)
5. Njezini roditelji su jako ponosni na nju. (Her parents are very proud of her.)

Note: I have placed a star (*) after each instance of "njezin" in the Serbian sentences for clarity.
