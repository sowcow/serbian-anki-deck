*Spavala je cijelu noć.(She slept all night.)
Ona je *spavala dugo.(She was sleeping for a long time.)
On je *spavao već sat vremena.(He had been sleeping for an hour.)
Njih dvoje su *spavali zajedno.(The two of them were sleeping together.)
*Spavala je još kad je zazvonio telefon.(She was still sleeping when the phone rang.)
Deca su *spavala najduže od svih.(The children were sleeping the longest of all.)
