*Puška* je bila jako važan deo ratne opreme. (The rifle was a very important part of the war equipment.)

On je uzeo *pušku* i ciljao na čoveka. (He took the rifle and aimed at the man.)

Ratnici su nosili *puške* preko ramena. (The soldiers were carrying rifles over their shoulders.)

Niko nije mogao da se suprotstavi *pušci* koju je on imao. (Nobody could oppose the rifle he had.)

Ona se uplašila kada je video *pušku*. (She got scared when she saw the rifle.)
