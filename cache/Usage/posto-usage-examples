:

*Posto* je već kasno, odlučio je da ode kući. (Since it was late, he decided to go home.)

*Posto* se oni nisu usaglasili, nisu uspeli da postignu dogovor. (Since they didn't agree, they failed to reach an agreement.)

*Posto* se oni dugo nisu videli, bila je to lepa prilika da se upoznaju bolje. (Since they hadn't seen each other for a long time, it was a nice opportunity to get to know each other better.)

*Posto* je bila veoma uspešna, ljudi su je počeli da cene. (Since she was very successful, people started to appreciate her.)
