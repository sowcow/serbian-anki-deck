Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "saslušaj" in different forms and positions:

1. *Saslušaj* me pažljivo, neću ponoviti (Listen carefully to me, I won't repeat myself)
2. Nadam se da ćeš *saslušati* moj savet (I hope you will listen to my advice)
3. Oni su *saslušali* sve svedoke u vezi sa slučajem (They listened to all the witnesses in connection with the case)
4. *Saslušajte* ovu pesmu, jako je lepa (Listen to this song, it's really beautiful)
5. Molim vas da me *saslušate* pre nego što donesete odluku (Please listen to me before making a decision)

In all of these sentences, the word "saslušaj" (or its various forms) means "listen" or "hear". The word is conjugated differently depending on the tense and subject of the sentence.
