Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "živio" in different forms and positions, along with their translations in English:

1. *Živio*! (Long live!/Cheers!)
2. Hvala na divnoj večeri, bilo je *živio*. (Thank you for the wonderful evening, it was great.)
3. Želim da čujem *živio* i od vas. (I want to hear "cheers" from you as well.)
4. On je bio *živ* i zdrav kad sam ga poslednji put video. (He was alive and well the last time I saw him.)
5. *Živeo* sam u Beogradu pet godina pre nego što sam se preselio u Novi Sad. (I lived in Belgrade for five years before moving to Novi Sad.)

Note: In the examples above, I have used an asterisk (*) to highlight the word "živio" in each sentence.
