Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "eni" in different forms and positions, along with their English translations in parentheses:

1. Eni* su došle da me posete. (The Enis came to visit me.)
2. Njena kćerka se zove Eni*. (Her daughter's name is Eni.)
3. Ja sam dao knjigu Eni*. (I gave the book to Eni.)
4. Eni* sam dao knjigu. (I gave Eni the book.)
5. Eni* nije bilo u školi juče. (Eni wasn't at school yesterday.)
6. Eni* je bilo mnogo zabavno na žurci sinoć. (Eni had a lot of fun at the party last night.)
7. Eni* voli da igra tenis. (Eni likes to play tennis.)
8. Eni* mi je pomogla da savladam matematiku. (Eni helped me master math.)

Note: In all of these sentences, the word "eni" is emphasized with an asterisk (*) for clarity, but in normal written and spoken Serbian, no emphasis is necessary.
