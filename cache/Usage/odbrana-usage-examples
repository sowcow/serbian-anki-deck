Sure, here are some examples:

1. *Odbor za odbranu* sela organizovao je sastanak. (Committee for defense of the village organized a meeting.)
2. Njegova *odbrana* na suđenju nije bila ubedljiva. (His defense at the trial was not convincing.)
3. Napadač je probio *odbranu* protivničkog tima i postigao gol. (The attacker broke through the defense of the opposing team and scored a goal.)
4. *Odbijena je žalba na presudu* i time je *odbrana* optuženog osuđena na zatvorsku kaznu. (The appeal against the verdict was rejected, and thus the defendant's defense was sentenced to imprisonment.)
5. *Odbrambeni stav* je važan u borilačkim veštinama. (Defensive stance is important in martial arts.)

I hope these examples help!
