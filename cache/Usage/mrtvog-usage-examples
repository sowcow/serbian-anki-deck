*Mrtvog* tijela nisu vidjeli u gradu. (They didn't see a dead body in the city.)

Ulica je bila puna *mrtvih* tijela. (The street was full of dead bodies.)

U vrtu je ležalo *mrtvog* ptica. (There was a dead bird lying in the garden.)

Kad je ona otvorila vrata ugledala je *mrtvu* osobu. (When she opened the door she saw a dead person.)

Niko nije želio da se bavi *mrtvima*. (Nobody wanted to deal with dead people.)
