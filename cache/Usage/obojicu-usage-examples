Note: The word "obojica" is used to refer to two people, and it can take on different forms depending on its grammatical function in the sentence (e.g. subject, object, etc.). In some of the sentences above, the word "oboje" is used instead, which is the dual form of "obojica" and is used to refer to two people when they are the object of the sentence.
