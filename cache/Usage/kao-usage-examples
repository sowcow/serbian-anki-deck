*Kao* da je vreme stalo. (As if time had stopped.)

Ona je *kao* pobedila. (She won as if.)

Bila je *kao* neverovatno. (It was as if incredible.)

Mislio sam *kao* da će se sve promeniti. (I thought as if everything would change.)

Znaš *kao* da nisam znao. (You know as if I didn't know.)

Bila je *kao* da nisam video nikada. (It was as if I hadn't seen ever.)
