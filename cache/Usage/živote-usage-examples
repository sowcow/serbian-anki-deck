*Živote*, ne vredi ti se puno truditi. (Life, it's not worth you trying too hard.)

Neznam šta da radim sa *životom*! (I don't know what to do with my life!)

Moj *život* je bio ustvari veoma srećan. (My life was actually very happy.)

Izgubio sam sva nadu u *život*. (I have lost all hope in life.)

*Živote*, nisam znao da je toliko zanimljivo. (Life, I didn't know it was so interesting.)
