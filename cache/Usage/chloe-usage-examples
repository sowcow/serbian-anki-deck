I'm sorry, but there is no Serbian word "Chloe" that would require inflection or usage in different positions. "Chloe" is a name and it is not inflected in Serbian, it remains the same in all cases and positions. However, I can provide some example sentences in Serbian that include the name "Chloe" for you:
