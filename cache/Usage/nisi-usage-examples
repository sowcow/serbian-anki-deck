*Nisi* jeo sladoled? (Did you eat ice cream?)
*Nisam* mogao da stignem na vreme. (I couldn't arrive on time.)
*Nije* čak ni pokušao da se obrati. (He didn't even try to contact.)
*Nisu* hteli da me primaju zbog toga. (They didn't want to accept me because of that.)
*Nijesmo* znali da će biti tako. (We didn't know it will be like this.)
