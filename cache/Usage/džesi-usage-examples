Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "džesi" in different forms and positions, with the word highlighted with a star (*) and translations in parentheses:

1. *Džesi* su danas popularni u celom svetu. (Jesse's are popular all around the world today.)
2. Znaš li da je *džesi* omiljeni restoran mojih prijatelja? (Do you know that Jesse's is my friends' favorite restaurant?)
3. *Džesi* se nalazi na uglu ovog bulevara. (*Jesse's* is located at the corner of this boulevard.)
4. Ko je taj momak koji stoji ispred *džesija*? (Who is that guy standing in front of *Jesse's*?)
5. Moja sestra je juče jela pljeskavicu u *džesiju*. (My sister had a hamburger at *Jesse's* yesterday.)

Note: In Serbian, "džesi" is a borrowed word from English and refers to the name "Jesse" or "Jesse's" (as in the name of a person or a place).
