*Bila* je tužna, ali je i dalje *bila* srećna. (She was sad, but she was still happy.)

*Budući* da znamo istinu, *bićemo* spremni da je prihvatimo. (Since we know the truth, we will be ready to accept it.)

*Bivši* prijatelji su se posvađali, ali se ipak *budući* nastavili da druže. (Former friends had a fight, but they still continued to hang out.)

*Bila* je mokra kada je izašla van, ali se nije mnogo obazirala. (She was wet when she went outside, but she didn't care much.)

Ona *biva* veoma ljuta kada neko kasni. (She gets very angry when someone is late.)
