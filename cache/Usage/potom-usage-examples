Sure, here are some examples:

1. Potom *ćeš* razumeti zašto sam to uradio. (Then *you will* understand why I did that.)
2. *Potom* su svi krenuli kući. (*Then* everyone went home.)
3. Nisam znao šta da radim *potom*. (I didn't know what to do *then*.)
4. *Potomak* kraljevske porodice bio je prisutan na ceremoniji. (A *descendant* of the royal family was present at the ceremony.)
5. Želim da postanem *potom* advokat. (I want to become a lawyer *later on*.)
6. Preuzeću odgovornost za to *potom*. (I will take responsibility for that *later*.)
7. Nisam zainteresovan za to sada, ali možda *potom*. (I'm not interested in that right now, but maybe *later*.)

Note: In the Serbian language, "potom" can have several meanings, including "then," "later," "afterward," "descendant," etc. In the examples above, I tried to showcase its different uses and forms.
