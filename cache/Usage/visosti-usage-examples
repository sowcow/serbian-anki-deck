*Visosti* se za kratko vreme pojavila na nebu. (A rainbow appeared in the sky shortly.)

Nova *visost* osvetlila je oblake. (The new rainbow illuminated the clouds.)

U daljini se videla *visosta*. (The rainbow was seen in the distance.)

*Visosti* su bile predivne. (The rainbows were beautiful.)

Gledali smo u zalazak sunca i *visosti* dugih krakova. (We looked at the sunset and the long-armed rainbows.)
