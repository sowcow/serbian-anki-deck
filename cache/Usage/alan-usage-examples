Note: In Serbian, "alan" can refer to a person's name (Alan), or it can be a noun meaning "elk." When used as a name, it can be declined as a masculine noun in the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and vocative case. When used as a noun, it can be declined in the same cases, but in the plural form.
