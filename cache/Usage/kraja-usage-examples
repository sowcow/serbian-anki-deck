:

*Kraja* je bilo sve tiho. (In the end it was all quiet.)
Niko nije mogao da shvati šta se desilo u *kraju*. (Nobody could understand what had happened in the end.)
*Kraju* je došao kraj njegove nade. (His hope came to an end.)
U *kraju* smo shvatili da nismo uspeli. (In the end we realized that we had not succeeded.)
