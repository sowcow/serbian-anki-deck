Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "kanal" in different forms and positions, with the starred word highlighted and their translations in English in parentheses:

1. *Kanal* je iskopan za navodnjavanje polja. (*Kanal* - The canal was dug for irrigating the fields.)
2. Nema dovoljno *kanala* za prenos signala na ovom području. (There aren't enough *channels* for transmitting signals in this area.)
3. Reka se razgranava u mnogo *kanala* dok se ne ulije u more. (The river branches off into many *channels* before it flows into the sea.)
4. *Kanalizacija* u ovom delu grada je potpuno zastarela. (*Sewer system* in this part of the city is completely outdated.)
5. Zbog lošeg *kanalisanja*, voda se zadržava na putevima nakon kiše. (Due to poor *drainage*, water accumulates on roads after rain.)

Note: Please keep in mind that Serbian is written in the Cyrillic script, so the word "kanal" is written as "канал" in its original form.
