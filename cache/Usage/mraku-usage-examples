*Mraku* se spustilo kao tama pošto je sunce zašlo. (Darkness descended as soon as the sun had set.)

Naselje je u potpunom *mraku*. (The settlement was in complete darkness.)

Kad bi se ugasio svetlo, u sobi se vratio *mrak*. (When the light was turned off, darkness returned to the room.)

U *mraku* je bilo teško videti šta se dešava. (It was hard to see what was happening in the dark.)

Izgubio se u *mraku*. (He got lost in the dark.)
