*Tek* je počeo da se smeje (He just started laughing).

*Tek* tada smo shvatili šta se desilo (Only then did we realise what had happened).

Od tada je prošlo *tek* nekoliko nedelja (Only a few weeks have passed since then).

Kada je napokon došao, *tek* je tada shvatio da nije spreman (When he finally arrived, he only then realised he wasn't prepared).

*Tek* je učinio ono što je trebao (He only then did what he was supposed to).
