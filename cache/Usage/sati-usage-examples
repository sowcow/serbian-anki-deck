1. *Sati* su se izmicali, a on još nije stigao. (The hours had slipped away, and he hadn't arrived yet.)

2. *Sati* će nam možda postati najbolji prijatelji. (The hours might become our best friends.)

3. On je već sata dva sedeo u bašti. (*Sati* he had already been sitting in the garden for two hours.)

4. U ovo vreme svi smo već zaspali. (At this time we had all already fallen asleep.)

5. U četiri *sata* ujutru ćemo već biti na putu. (At four o'clock in the morning we will already be on our way.)
