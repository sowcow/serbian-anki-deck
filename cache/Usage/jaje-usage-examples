Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "jaje" in different forms and positions:

1. *Jaje* je sastojak mnogih jela. (The egg is an ingredient in many dishes.)
2. Uzela je tri *jajeta* iz frižidera. (She took three eggs from the fridge.)
3. *Jajima* je potrebno petnaest minuta da se skuvaju. (Eggs need fifteen minutes to boil.)
4. Mala deca vole da boje *jaja* za Uskrs. (Small children like to dye eggs for Easter.)
5. Kokoška je snela *jaje* u gnezdo. (The chicken laid an egg in the nest.)

Note: The word "jaje" means "egg" in Serbian. I have highlighted the word with an asterisk (*) as requested, and provided translations for each sentence in English in parentheses.
