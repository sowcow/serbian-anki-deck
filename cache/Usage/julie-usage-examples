Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "julie" in different forms and positions, along with translations in English:

1. Julie je danas bila u školi. (Julie was at school today.)
2. Ova pesma mi uvek izmami osmeh na lice, zbog njenih julskih reči. (This song always brings a smile to my face because of its July words.)
3. Da li ćeš ti biti na našoj rođendanskoj žurci, Julie? (Will you be at our birthday party, Julie?)
4. Na današnji dan, pre tačno godinu dana, Julie je postala moja najbolja prijateljica. (On this day, exactly one year ago, Julie became my best friend.)
5. Julie se vratila iz Pariza pre nekoliko dana. (Julie returned from Paris a few days ago.)

Note: In Serbian, "Julie" is a female name pronounced "yoo-lee-eh" and written as "Јули" in the Cyrillic alphabet. In the sentences above, "Julie" is used either as a subject (1, 3, 4, 5) or as an attribute modifying a noun (2).
