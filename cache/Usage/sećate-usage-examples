*Sećate* se nedelje kada smo bili u parku? (Do you remember the Sunday when we were in the park?)

Nismo *sećali* se da je to zabranjeno. (We didn't remember that it was forbidden.)

Nisam *sećao* se da je to bilo tako. (I didn't remember that it was like that.)

Oni *sećaju* da su jednom bili tamo. (They remember that they were once there.)

Oni se *sećaju* stvari koje su događale pre. (They remember the things that happened before.)
