Slušam *glas* muzike (I am listening to the voice of music).
Mislio sam da slušaš *sve* što ti kažem (I thought you were listening to everything I said).
Oni *slušaju* sebe (They are listening to themselves).
Moj brat *sluša* svoju muziku (My brother is listening to his music).
On *sluša* mene (He is listening to me).
