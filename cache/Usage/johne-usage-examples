Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "johne" in different forms and positions:

1. Johne *mi* je najdraži grad u Srbiji. (Johne *to* je my favorite city in Serbia.)
Translation: Johne is the name of a city, and in this sentence it is in the dative case, indicating the city is the recipient of the action.

2. *Johne* je veoma posećen tokom leta. (*Johne* is very crowded during the summer.)
Translation: Johne is the subject of the sentence, so it is not modified.

3. Ukoliko želite da posetite *Johna*, savetujem vam da rezervišete smeštaj unapred. (If you want to visit Johne, I suggest you book accommodation in advance.)
Translation: Johne is in the accusative case, indicating it is the object of the verb "posetiti" (to visit).

4. Oni su bili u *Johnu* samo jedan dan. (They were in Johne for only one day.)
Translation: Johne is in the locative case, indicating location.

5. U *Johnu* se nalazi mnogo znamenitosti koje možete posetiti. (In Johne, there are many sights you can visit.)
Translation: Johne is in the locative case, indicating location.

I hope these examples help!
