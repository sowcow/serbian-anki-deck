*Ostali* su odavno otišli sa društvenih mreža. (The others have long gone from the social networks.)

Svi su *ostali* zabezeknuti nakon toga. (Everyone else was stunned after that.)

*Ostalih* pet članova porodice nikada nisu se vratili u zemlju. (The other five members of the family never returned to the country.)

*Ostali* su začuđeni njegovim potezima. (The others were amazed by his moves.)
