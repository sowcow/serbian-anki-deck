Sure, here are some examples of how to use the Serbian word "hoće" in different forms and positions:

1. *Hoćeš* li da dođeš sa mnom u grad? (Do you want to come to the city with me?)
2. Ona *hoće* da ide na more ove godine. (She wants to go to the sea this year.)
3. *Hoćete li* kafu ili čaj? (Would you like coffee or tea?)
4. Ja *neću* da idem na tu žurku. (I don't want to go to that party.)
5. Oni *neće* da pričaju o tome. (They don't want to talk about it.)
6. *Hoćete li* da čujete moje mišljenje o tome? (Would you like to hear my opinion about that?)
7. On *neće* da radi ono što mu se ne sviđa. (He won't do what he doesn't like.)
8. *Hoćeš* li mi pomoći da nosim ove torbe? (Will you help me carry these bags?)

Note: In Serbian, "hoće" is the present tense third person singular of the verb "hteti" which means "to want". "Hoćete" is the present tense second person plural, meaning "you want". "Neće" is the negative form of "hteti", meaning "do not want".
