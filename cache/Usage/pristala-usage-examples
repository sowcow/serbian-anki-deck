Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "pristala":

1. Ona *pristala* na taj plan. (She agreed to that plan.)
2. Da li bi ti *pristala* na to? (Would you agree to that?)
3. On nije *pristao* na tu ponudu. (He didn't agree to that offer.)
4. Oboje su *pristali* na tu ideju. (Both of them agreed to that idea.)
5. Ona nije htela da *pristane* na tu kompromisnu verziju. (She didn't want to agree to that compromised version.)

In these sentences, the word "pristala" appears in different forms and positions:

- *Pristala* - present tense, third person singular form of the verb "pristati" (to agree)
- *Pristao* - past tense, third person singular masculine form of the verb "pristati"
- *Pristali* - past tense, third person plural form of the verb "pristati"
- *Pristane* - present tense, third person singular future form of the verb "pristati"
- *Pristala* - past tense, feminine singular form of the verb "pristati"

I hope that helps!
