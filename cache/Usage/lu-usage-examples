Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "lu" in different forms and positions:

1. *Lu* je najslađe povrće. (The onion is the sweetest vegetable.)
2. U salati ima previše *luka*. (There is too much onion in the salad.)
3. *Luk* se koristi kao začin u mnogim jelima. (Onion is used as a seasoning in many dishes.)
4. Dodajte *luku* u šerpu i pržite ga na maslacu. (Add onion to the pan and fry it in butter.)
5. Zbog *luka* sam se rasplakao. (I cried because of the onion.)

In each of these sentences, the word "lu" appears in a different form and position:

- "lu" - this is the basic form of the word, used as a subject in sentence 1.
- "luka" - this is the genitive form of the word, used as an object of the preposition "u" in sentence 2.
- "luk" - this is the nominative form of the word, used as a subject in sentence 3.
- "luku" - this is the accusative form of the word, used as an object of the verb "dodajte" in sentence 4.
- "luka" - this is the genitive form of the word, used as a reason for crying in sentence 5.

I hope this helps!
