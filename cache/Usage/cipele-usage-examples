*Cipele* su mi bile previše uske. (My shoes were too tight.)

*Cipelama* su bile dodate nove pete. (New heels were added to the shoes.)

Njegov otac mu je kupio nove *cipele*. (His father bought him new shoes.)

Ona je nosila svoje najlepše *cipele*. (She was wearing her prettiest shoes.)

On je obukao svoje crne *cipele*. (He put on his black shoes.)

Ona je ponosno pokazala svoje nove *cipele*. (She proudly showed off her new shoes.)
