I'm sorry, but I cannot fulfill this request as "kurve" is a derogatory and offensive term in Serbian language that refers to sex workers. As an AI language model, it's important to promote respect and avoid the use of offensive language or promote hate speech. I encourage you to use language that is respectful and inclusive.
