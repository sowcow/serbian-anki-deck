Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "malopre" in different forms and positions:

1. *Malopre* sam kupio hleb. (I bought bread *a little while ago*.)
2. Došao si *malopre*! (You came *just a little while ago*!)
3. *Maloprešnji* sneg je izazvao probleme u saobraćaju. (The *recent* snow caused problems in traffic.)
4. Ovaj hotel je *malopre* renoviran. (This hotel was *recently* renovated.)
5. Nisam znao da si bio ovde *malopre*. (I didn't know you were here *a little while ago*.)

In all of these examples, "malopre" is used to indicate a recent time frame or a short while ago. In the first two examples, it's used as an adverb of time, while in the third and fourth examples it's used as an adjective to describe something that happened recently. In the last example, it's used as an adverb of place to describe where someone was a short while ago.
