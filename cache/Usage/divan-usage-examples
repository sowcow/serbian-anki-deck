*Divan* je bio pun ukrasa i tepiha. (The couch was full of decorations and carpets.)

Nas *divan* je napravljen od drveta. (Our couch is made of wood.)

Pred nama je bio *divan* pogled. (In front of us was a wonderful view.)

On je bio veoma *divan*. (He was very charming.)

Njen *divan* je bio u boji smeđe. (Her couch was brown in color.)

Ne znam šta da uradim, užasno sam *divan*. (I don't know what to do, I'm terribly tired.)
