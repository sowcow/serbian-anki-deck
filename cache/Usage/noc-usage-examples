*Noc* je bila duga i mračna. (The night was long and dark.)

*Noć* se približavala, a ja nisam mogla da zaspem. (Night was approaching, and I couldn't fall asleep.)

Kroz prozor je dopirala *noćna* tišina. (Through the window, night silence was coming.)

*Noću*, pred zoru, čovek se probudio. (At night, before dawn, the man woke up.)

U *noći* je bio potpuno svetlosti. (At night there was complete darkness.)
