Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "gđe" in different forms and positions, with the starred word highlighted and English translations in parentheses:

1. *Gđe* ste sinoć bili? (Where were you last night?)
2. Došla je *gđa* Jovanović u posetu. (Ms. Jovanović came for a visit.)
3. *Gđa* Marković je izuzetna profesorka. (Ms. Marković is an exceptional teacher.)
4. Molim vas, recite mi *gđi* Đorđević šta se desilo. (Please tell Ms. Đorđević what happened.)
5. Žalba je poslata *gđi* Marić pre dva dana. (The complaint was sent to Ms. Marić two days ago.)

Note: "Gđe" is a short form of "gospođe" which is a formal and polite way of addressing or referring to a woman in Serbian, similar to "Mrs." or "Ms." in English.
