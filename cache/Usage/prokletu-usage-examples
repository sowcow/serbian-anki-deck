Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "prokletu" in different forms and positions:

1. *Prokleto* teško je ovo uraditi sam. (Damn hard to do this alone.)
2. Ova *prokleta* kiša ne prestaje. (This damn rain won't stop.)
3. *Prokleti* budilnik me je probudio prerano. (Damn alarm clock woke me up too early.)
4. Ne mogu da verujem da je izgubio zbog jedne *proklete* greške. (I can't believe he lost because of one damn mistake.)
5. *Prokletom* srećom, uspeo sam da stignem na vreme. (Damn lucky, I managed to arrive on time.)

And here are their translations in English:

2. This damn rain won't stop.
3. Damn alarm clock woke me up too early.
4. I can't believe he lost because of one damn mistake.
