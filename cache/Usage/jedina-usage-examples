*Jedina* je bila ona koja je imala hrabrosti da se suprotstavi. (She was the only one who had the courage to oppose.)

Njegova *jedinom* željom je bila sloboda. (His only desire was freedom.)

*Jedinu* nadu je imao u uspeh. (He had only hope for success.)

On je imao *jedinu* grešku. (He had only one mistake.)

Ništa nije moglo da zaustavi njegovu *jedinu* želju. (Nothing could stop his only wish.)
