*Mada* je bilo hladno, mi smo i dalje otišli u park. (Although it was cold, we still went to the park.)

*Mada* se svi trudili, nismo uspeli da postignemo rezultat. (Even though we all tried, we weren't able to achieve the result.)

Krenuli smo putem *mada* nismo znali gde ćemo stići. (We started the journey although we didn't know where we would end up.)

*Mada* je bilo dosta ljudi, ustvari se niko nije zabavio. (Although there were a lot of people, actually nobody had fun.)

Krenuli su u šetnju *mada* nije bilo vremena. (They went for a walk even though there was no time.)
