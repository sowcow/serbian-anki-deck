*Svetlo* je bilo magično. (The light was magical.)
Nasmejala se u *svetlu* dana. (She smiled in the light of the day.)
Kada se zalutala, tražila je *svetlo*. (When she got lost, she was searching for light.)
Kako je preplavilo *svetlo* u njenom srcu. (How the light flooded her heart.)
Ona je bila poput *svetla* u mraku. (She was like a light in the darkness.)
Ona je osvetlila svaki kutak svog doma *svetlom*. (She lit up every corner of her home with light.)
Bio je srećan kad je video *svetlo* na kraju tunela. (He was happy when he saw the light at the end of the tunnel.)
