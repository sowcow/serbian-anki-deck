*Stoje* nasred ulice. (They are standing in the middle of the street.)

*Stojeći* u redu, čekala je svoj red. (Standing in line, she was waiting for her turn.)

Svi *stoje* uz njega. (Everyone stands by him.)

Vozila *stoje* uz cestu. (The vehicles are parked by the road.)

U hodniku *stojala* je stara klupa. (An old bench was standing in the hallway.)

*Stojim* u potpunom zaprepašćenju. (I stand in complete shock.)
