*Vjerovati* mu je bilo vrlo teško. (It was very hard to believe him.)

Ona nikada neće *vjerovati* da je to stvarno. (She will never believe that it is real.)

Mnogi ljudi ne *vjeruju* u bajke. (Many people don't believe in fairy tales.)

On nikada ne bi *vjerovao* da je to moguće. (He would never have believed that it was possible.)

Oni ne žele *vjerovati* meni. (They don't want to believe me.)
