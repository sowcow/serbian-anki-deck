Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "sereš" in different forms and positions:

1. *Sereš* li ti uvek u ovo vreme? (Do you always *shit* at this time?)
2. Ne mogu da verujem da si opet *serao* sinoć! (I can't believe you *talked shit* again last night!)
3. Kad ćeš prestati da *seruckaš* po celom stanu? (When will you stop *making a mess* all over the apartment?)
4. Mama me je izgrdila zato što sam *seruckao* po kući. (Mom scolded me because I *made a mess* around the house.)
5. Ako me još jednom *opsereteš*, prekinuću svaki kontakt s tobom! (If you *talk shit* to me one more time, I'll cut off all contact with you!)
6. Nemoj da mi *seruckaš* po stanu, molim te! (Please don't *make a mess* around my apartment!)

In these sentences, "sereš" is used in different forms: as a verb in the present tense (sereš), as a verb in the past tense (serao), and as a verb in the infinitive form (seruckaš, opsereteš, seruckaš). It is used in different positions within the sentence as well, sometimes at the beginning (*Sereš* li ti), sometimes in the middle (opsereteš), and sometimes at the end (seruckaš po celom stanu). The translations in English are provided in parentheses.
