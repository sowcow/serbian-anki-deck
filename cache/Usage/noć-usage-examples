*Noć* je bila duga i mračna. (The night was long and dark.)

Malo dete se preplašilo u toj *noći*. (The little child was scared in that night.)

*Noću* se nikad ne bih usudila da prošetam samu. (I would never dare to go for a walk alone at night.)

On je večerao *noću*. (He had dinner at night.)

*Noći* su postale tmurne i hladne. (The nights became gloomy and cold.)
