*Gledao* sam televiziju pre dva sata. (I watched TV two hours ago.)

*Gledala* je sestra decu dok su igrali. (My sister was watching the children while they were playing.)

Niko nije *gledao* u njegovom pravcu. (Nobody was looking in his direction.)

*Gledali* smo film dok je padala kiša. (We were watching a movie while it was raining.)

*Gledanje* televizije se smatra lošim navikom. (Watching TV is considered a bad habit.)
