Sure, here are some example sentences in Serbian that use the word "buka" in different forms and positions with a star (*) right after it, and their translations in English in parentheses:

1. *Buka* nas je probudila ujutro. (The *noise* woke us up in the morning.)

4. *Buka* je bila toliko jaka da sam se tresao. (The *loudness* was so strong that I was shaking.)
5. Molim vas da smanjite *buku*, ne mogu da se koncentrišem. (Please reduce the *noise*, I can't concentrate.)
6. Iako volim da idem na koncerte, ponekad je *buka* previše jaka za moje uši. (Although I like going to concerts, sometimes the *volume* is too loud for my ears.)
7. U gradu uveče uvek ima puno *buke* i gužve. (There's always a lot of *noise* and crowds in the city at night.)
