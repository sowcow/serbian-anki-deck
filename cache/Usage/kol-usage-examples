Sure, here are five example sentences in Serbian that use the word "kol" in different forms and positions, with the starred word highlighted and English translations in parentheses:

1. Kol*iko ćeš da platiš za taj auto? (How much will you pay for that car?)
2. Volim da jedem kol*ače sa makom. (I like to eat poppy seed cakes.)
3. Kol*ena su joj povređena nakon pada. (Her knees are injured after the fall.)
4. Ne mogu da poverujem kol*iko je brz ovaj internet. (I can't believe how fast this internet is.)
5. Kol*ima se dođe do vrha planine. (You can reach the top of the mountain by cable car.)

Note: The word "kol" is not a standalone word in Serbian and requires a suffix to form a complete word. The examples above show different suffixes used with the word "kol" to form different words, such as "koliko" (how much), "kolači" (cakes), "kolena" (knees), "kolima" (by cable car), and "koliko" (how much).
